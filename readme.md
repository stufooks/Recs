# Recs

## Description

Recs is a React Native app geared towards iOS for saving recommendations on music, books, and shows/movies. It is integrated with the Spotify Web API and the Open Library API for making accessing music and books easy after inputting recommendations.

## Example

When you start the app, you can navigate tot he 'Add' page in the bottom tab navigator and input a song title and artist. The song will then be saved to your library, where you can open a detailed view of the song that includes a link to the long on Spotify.

## Tech Used

- React Native
- Expo
- Spotify Web API
- Open Library API
- Axios

## Installation

 Clone down this repository, cd into the new directory, and run an npm install.

 ## Future Features

 The app is still in development at this time. I would like to interact with a third API to build out the functionality for movies/shows. At this point the app only functions for music and books.

 The Spotify API client credentials authorization flow is also currently throwing an error which needs to be fixed.
